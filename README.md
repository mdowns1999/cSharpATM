# Overview

Welcome to my C# ATM program!  The reason why I did this was to practice using the C Sharp Language.  This is my first time using it!  It was very intersting to learn.  I am not a master at it, but I am starting to see why a lot of people use it.  I used many loops, conditional statements, lists, and basic C Sharp Syntax.  

Like I mentioned above, the purpose of this project was to practice C#.  With an ATM program, I had to use loops for user validation and to loop through lists, use lists to store or update values based off of a persons account.  I also used a switch case to help direct the program to where it needed to go to do the proper transactions.  The program does only a few simple tasks.  Those tasks include, View the accounts current amount, depositing money into the account, withdrawling money out of the account, Viewing the past five transactions, and seeing a Bank Report.

# Development Environment

The IDE I used was Visual Studio Code by Microsoft.  I have used this IDE before and found it easy to use.  I also had to install .Net SDK and use a C# extention in order to program in C#.  

I did not use any extra libraries for this project besides what was built into the program.  I did find it very useful that each class I used did not need an import statement since it was in the same scope.  That is very nice!

# Future Work
* Hook it up to an Interface
* Possibly hook it up to a database.
* Run more Test cases and find bugs.
